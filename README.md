__Development Log__

05/25-Today I worked on creating the maze. I created the main sketch and the Maze class, where I then inputted the generate and comparable methods from our MazeGenerator assignment, and used as part of the constructor for the maze. I also made a display method for the maze, which allows it to be scaled to fit the entire screen, regardless of the size of the screen or the maze array.

05/25- Today I worked on adding an end location for the maze generated in the Maze class. I modified the generate method Ella added and used some of my own code from the MazeGenerator assignment to add more helper methods to generate the maze. I made it so that the end location is at the end of the longest route that is carved from the start location.
