__Development Log__

_Ella_

05/25-Today I worked on creating the maze. I created the main sketch and the Maze class, where I then inputted the generate and comparable methods from our MazeGenerator assignment, and used as part of the constructor for the maze. I also made a display method for the maze, which allows it to be scaled to fit the entire screen, regardless of the size of the screen or the maze array.
